Stress images were obtained \\napproximately 30 minutes following tracer injection. \\nImaging protocol: Gated SPECT. \\nThis study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial \\nperfusion model. \\n\\nFINDINGS: \\nThe image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and \\nbreast attenuation.\\nLeft ventricular cavity size is increased.\\nRest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake \\nthroughout the left ventricular myocardium. \\nGated images reveal normal wall motion. \\nThe calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 59% with an \\nEDV of 117 ml.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1.
