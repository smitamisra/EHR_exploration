Stress images were obtained \\napproximately 30 minutes following tracer injection. \\nImaging protocol: Gated SPECT. \\nThis study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial \\nperfusion model. \\n\\nFINDINGS: \\nThe image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and \\nbreast attenuation.\\nLeft ventricular cavity size is increased.\\nRest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake \\nthroughout the left ventricular myocardium. \\nGated images reveal normal wall motion. \\nThe calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 59% with an \\nEDV of 117 ml.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1.

She was able to be transitioned \\nto a PO regimen of lasix 40mg qday on ___ (day of discharge). \\nDry weight on day of discharge was 75.9kg.\\n\\n# Chest Tightness:\\nPatient reported chest tightness associated with her shortness \\nof breath.

Due to her \\nsignificant CAD history, she underwent a P-MIBI on ___ which \\nwas unremarkable. Her chest tightness was thought to be of \\nnon-cardiac etiology.\\n\\n# HTN:\\nPatient presented with SBP of 190-200. Cardiology was consulted \\nand recommended increasing her carvedilol from 6.25mg BID to \\n12.5mg BID. With this change, and continuation of her other home \\nmedications, her blood pressure decreased to systolics in range \\nof 110-146 on day of discharge. It is unclear whether her very \\nelevated BP on admission was occurring in the setting of \\nmedication non-compliance.
