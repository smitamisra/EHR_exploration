While here, you underwent an ultrasound of your heart, which showed dilation in the setting of excess fluid, as well as intact squeeze (a condition called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF). We gave you IV medications in order to take fluid off, and as fluid was removed, your breathing improved. When you left the hospital, a total of 136 pounds of fluid were removed. Your \"dry weight\" was 369.7 lbs. You were discharged home with a medication called torsemide at a dose of 100 milligrams two times a day. This medication will help you keep fluid off. Because of low potassium caused by this drug, we started you on a drug called spironolactone to keep your potassium up and you will need to take oral potassium as well. Please weigh yourself at home every day, and if your weight increases by more than 2 lbs in a day or by more than 5 lbs in a week, please call your doctor.You also had an ultrasound of your legs, which showed a possible blood clot. In addition, you were noted on the heart monitor to have an abnormal fast heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. For the blood clot and for the abnormal heart rhythm, you were started on blood thinner medications (initially heparin through an IV, and later an oral medication called warfarin). In addition, in order to prevent your heart from beating too fast, you were started on a medication to slow the heart rate called metoprolol. Finally, given the blood clot we saw, it shall be important for you to followup with your primary care physician for blood tests for a condition called hypercoagulability, which is the tendency to form blood clots.During routine blood tests, you also tested positive for type 2, or adultonset, diabetes (more specifically, your HbA1c test was 6.5 %, and 6.5 % is the cutoff for being positive for diabetes, with higher numbers indicating higher average blood sugars). In addition, you were started on a medication called atorvastatin, which prevents heart disease and lowers cholesterol. You might also consider starting a medication called metformin for the diabetes, and your PCP can decide whether to do this. In addition, we discussed how weight loss and exercise (even exercise in the absence of weight loss) will be key to controlling your blood sugars and diabetes in the future. Throughout your admission, you were noted to have low oxygen levels. These oxygen levels improved with a breathing machine and mask called BiPAP. We suspect that you may have a condition called obstructive sleep apnea as well as \"obesity hypoventilation syndrome\", which causes your lungs to not fill adequately. You underwent a \"right heart catheterization\" to measure pressures in your lungs, and we found that you have high lung pressures called \"pulmonary hypertension\". Because of this, you will need to wear your oxygen every day and your CPAP every night to help you reduce your lung pressures. You will need to see a pulmonologist (lung doctor) as an outpatient when you leave.You expressed interest in Bariatric Surgery during this admission, which is a type of surgery that can help patients lose weight. Diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea and overall general health can all be improved with weight loss. Please talk to your PCP to receive  referral to Bariatric Surgery.

       " \"Dear  ,You presented with sudden onset of chest pain and associated shortness of breath. Your cardiac enzymes and EKG were reassuring, but given your cardiac risk factors of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia we pursued cardiac monitoring and testing. Stress test showed normal perfusion (blood flow) to your heart and normal pumping function of your heart.  This is very reassuring and very unlikely that your chest pain was due to a heart attack.A CAT scan of your chest did not suggest pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the vessels supplying your lung) or arterial dissection. The image showed a left lower lobe lung consolidation that is suggestive of possible pneumonia. As we discussed it is possible this is another condition like atelectasis (small area of collapsed lung) and less likely a mass. Even though  you had no fever or cough we treated you for pneumonia with Levofloxacin given limited other causes for your presentation. Radiology recommends a repeat CT chest in 6 weeks to test for resolution of this imaging abnormality.  We also discussed the possibility that this imaging finding could be a result of a process your PCP   weeks ago with antibiotics when you presented to them with back pain. You were found to have a left leg DVT. This was treated with anticoagulation (blood thinner). You have been treated for this before. We plan to restart the same blood thinner that you tolerated in the past at time of discharge. You should follow with your PCP for hematologist referral to discuss further investigation about your recurrent clots and need for lifelong anticoagulation. You should reschedule your outpatient vascular testing to help evaluate your leg swelling as we were not able to complete it as an inpatient. Continue to elevate your legs. Lastly, you expressed some difficulty swallowing or an abnormal feeling with this.
