Diffusely echogenic liver, suggestive of fatty infiltration. \\nOther forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease \\nincluding fibrosis and cirrhosis cannot be excluded. \\n2. Layering sludge within the gallbladder, with mild gallbladder \\nwall \\nthickening, which may relate to underlying liver disease.  \\n3. Patent portal venous system. \\n4. Moderate ascites. \\nThe study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. \\n\\n\\nCT abd/pelvis ___\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1. Large volume ascites and enlarged edematous liver. The \\nfindings are \\nsuggestive of acute hepatitis.  \\n2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.\\n\\nECHO ___:\\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left \\nventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global \\nsystolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue \\nDoppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal \\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no \\nventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and \\nfree wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the \\nsinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve \\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \\nexcursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears \\nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is \\nno mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion. \\n\\nIMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic \\nfunction. No diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension or \\npathologic valvular disease seen.\\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nThis is a ___ woman with history of EtOH ___ years, \\nheavy at times, with new onset liver failure and ascites.  \\n  \\n#  ASCITES/LFTs:  New onset ascites with SAAG supportive of \\nportal hypertension.  Likely alcoholic hepatitis with ascites \\nand possibility of cirrhosis.  Steroids and pentoxyphyline were \\ndeferred given her low discriminate factor.  In terms of other \\netiologies of liver disease, iron panel was not consistent with \\nhemochromatosis, and ___, AMA, ___ were negative, making \\nautoimmune causes unlikely.  Alpha 1 antitrypsin and \\nceruloplasmin were normal.  Viral studies show immunity to Hep B \\nand A.  HIV was negative.  U/S and CT abd/pelvis were not \\nsuggestive of mass or obstructive lesions.  Patient received a \\n2.5L paracentesis on ___, day prior to discharge.  Low-dose \\nspironolactone was started.  Ms. ___ will follow-up with \\nDr. ___ in 1 week.\\n  \\n#  ALCOHOLISM:  On admission, alcohol level was 336 though \\npatient was clinically sober.  Patient was monitored on a CIWA \\nscale and treated with MVI, thiamine, and folate.  She was seen \\nby social work and given the contact information for rehab \\nfacilities.  Although patient was encouraged to enter ___ \\nrehab, she refused.  She will seek outpatient treatment for her \\naddiction.  Ms. ___ was warned on multiple occasions that \\nif she continues to drink she will irreperably destroy her liver \\nand could even die.\\n\\n#  BACK PAIN:  Patient was started on a lidocaine patch and \\ngiven oxycodone for breakthrough pain while in the hospital.\\n  \\n#  LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Likely a combination of alcoholic hepatitis \\nand UTI; patient was started on ciprofloxacin.  Other infectious \\nwork-up was unrevealing.  On day prior to discharge, patient \\nspiked a fever to 101 and was pan cultured.  CXR was unrevealing \\nand urine was negative for infection after the Cipro.  Ms. \\n___ was discharged on levofloxacin for a 5 day course.\\n  \\n#  MACROCYTIC ANEMIA:  Likely from folate and nutritional \\ndeficiency in setting of alcoholism.  Patient was started on MV, \\nthiamine, and folate supplementation.  HCT was monitored \\nthroughout admission.\\n\\n#  ANXIETY:  Patient with marked anxiety.  She would likely \\nbenefit from outpatient therapy and/or SSRI treatment.\\n\\n#  SINUS TACHYCARDIA:  Likely in context of decompensated liver \\ndisease.  ECHO was within normal limits.  Patient was monitred \\non telemetry throughout hospitalization.\\n\\n#  CONSTIPATION:  Patient was maintained on senna and colace.\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nNone.\\n \\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.
